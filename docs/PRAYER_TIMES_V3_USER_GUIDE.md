# Prayer Times v3.0 - User Guide

## What's New? 🎉

Your prayer times just got a major upgrade! The app now uses advanced technology to provide the most accurate prayer times possible.

### Key Improvements

✅ **More Accurate** - Prayer times are now accurate to within 1-2 minutes  
✅ **Verified** - Multiple sources check each other for accuracy  
✅ **Transparent** - See how confident the app is in the times (0-100%)  
✅ **Reliable** - Works even if one source fails  
✅ **Faster** - Times load quicker and use less battery  

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Calculation

The app automatically:
- Gets your GPS location
- Fetches times from multiple sources
- Compares and validates the results
- Shows you the most accurate times

**You don't need to do anything!** Just open the app and your prayer times are ready.

### 2. Confidence Score

You'll now see a **confidence score** (0-100%) that tells you how accurate the times are:

- **80-100% (Green)** ✅ - Excellent! Multiple sources agree
- **60-79% (Yellow)** ⚠️ - Good, but some minor differences
- **0-59% (Red)** ❌ - Low confidence, may want to refresh

### 3. Source Information

The app shows you which source was used:
- **Aladhan API** - Online prayer time service
- **Local Calculation** - Astronomical calculations on your device
- **Consensus** - Average of multiple sources

## Using the App

### Prayer List

Tap any prayer to mark it as completed:

```
☑ Fajr    5:30 AM   ✓ Completed
☐ Dhuhr   12:45 PM  
☐ Asr     4:15 PM   
☐ Maghrib 6:30 PM   
☐ Isha    8:00 PM   
```

### Prayer Settings

Access settings by tapping the gear icon ⚙️ on the home screen.

#### Calculation Method

Choose the method that matches your local mosque:

- **ISNA (North America)** ⭐ Recommended for US/Canada
- Muslim World League
- Egyptian
- Karachi
- Umm al-Qura (Makkah)
- Dubai
- Qatar
- Kuwait
- Moonsighting Committee
- Singapore
- Tehran
- Turkey

**Tip**: If you're in Aurora, IL or nearby, use ISNA (North America).

#### Fine-Tuning

Adjust each prayer time by adding or subtracting minutes:

```
Fajr:    [−] +0 min [+]
Dhuhr:   [−] +0 min [+]
Asr:     [−] +0 min [+]
Maghrib: [−] +0 min [+]
Isha:    [−] +0 min [+]
```

**When to use**:
- Your local mosque times differ slightly
- You want to pray a few minutes early
- You need to match exact community times

**Example**: If your mosque's Fajr is 5 minutes earlier, set Fajr to -5 minutes.
